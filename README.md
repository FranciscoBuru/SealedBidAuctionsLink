# Sealed Bid Auctions for ERC-721 NFT's 

Chainlink Hackathon Spring 2022 project. Here you will find the implementation of a sealed bid auction protocol for ERC-721 tokens that uses chainlink price oracles to check times ( weird right? I'll eventually elaborate on that ) and chainlink keepers to automate executions.

This project is the second iteration of my Computer Engineering Thesis project. 

Happy Hacking!
